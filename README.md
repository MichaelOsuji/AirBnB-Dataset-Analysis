# AirBnB Data Analysis

This analysis was performed on a 2016 AirBnB dataset containing house price listings of various bedroom apartments in an area in Washington DC.

## Questions interested in Answering
- The number of rooms generating the most revenue for the business
- The month with the highest demand
- The rooms with the least demand

## Steps Utilized
- Connected tables to *TABLEAU* for the visualization process
- Selected the appropriate Join Type to perform efficient analysis on the dataset.

## Key Insights Derived
- The 1 bedroom is in highest demand, thereby generating the most revenue for the business.
- The 6 bedroom has the least demand, thereby suggesting that the people renting them are usually people living alone or people living without a large family.
- December seems to be month with the highest demand for rooms. This might be due to the festive period or an event that goes on around that time of the year.
